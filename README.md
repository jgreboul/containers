# Containers Repository
Welcome to the **Containers** repository! This is a collection of ready-to-use, self-contained Docker environments, designed to make it easy for developers, researchers, and hobbyists to spin up useful tools with minimal configuration.

---

## Structure

Each container setup is organized in its own **subdirectory**, containing:
- A `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile` file.
- A `README.md` specific to that setup
- Any configuration files or scripts needed

```
containers/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ollama-openwebui/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
...
```
